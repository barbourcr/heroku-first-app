    "# Exploring how to query and analyze salesforce data using Heroku and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a free heroku account (https://www.heroku.com)\n",
    "- Install a distribution of Python. I would recommend the anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com), which includes Jupyter notebook, a very useful interface for working with Python.\n",
    "- Need to install either git (https://git-scm.com/) or heroku CLI (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) in order to deploy apps. I already have git installed, so that is what I am going with. Note sure that we will get to that today.\n",
    "- Note: We may also need to download PostgresSQL on to our local computer... We can find out in the first meeting!\n",
    "\n",
    "## To create first App\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log in to Heroku account (https://www.heroku.com)\n",
    "- Click \"Create new app\"\n",
    "- Enter an app name (must be unique across Heroku) and click \"Create App\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link with Salesforce org\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your first app is created. We will link the app with a Salesforce org (developer edition for practice) which will allow us to Query our salesforce data directly from Python (or R, or some other interface). First, we need to provision some add-ons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the App, click on the \"Overview\" tab.\n",
    "- Click the \"Configure Add-ons\" link next to \"Installed add-ons\".\n",
    "- Under \"Add-ons\", search for and select \"Heroku Postgres\". Ensure that plan name states \"Hobby Dev - Free\" and click \"Provision\"\n",
    "- Similarly, search for and select \"Heroku Connect\", ensuring that the plan name states \"Demo Edition - Free\" before clicking \"Provision\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the add-ons, we can link our Heroku App to a Salesforce org.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Under the \"Resources\" tab, click on Heroku Connect.\n",
    "- Under the \"Overview\" tab, click on \"Setup Connection\".\n",
    "- Click on DATABASE_URL (leave schema name as salesforce) and click \"Next\".\n",
    "- Select which environment you want to link (Prodiction, Sandbox, etc.) and click \"Authorize\".\n",
    "- Enter the log-in information for the Salesforce org that you are linking too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that is Heroku is linked with our Salesforce org, let's select which objects and fields we want to include. For purposes of this excercise, we will link the Opportunity object and the following fields: Name, StageName, IsClosed, IsWon, and Amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While still under Heroku Connect, click the \"Mappings\" tab and click \"Create Mapping\".\n",
    "- Click on the Opportunity object.\n",
    "- Ensure that the following fields are selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Name\n",
    "        StageName\n",
    "        IsClosed\n",
    "        IsWon\n",
    "        Amount\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Click \"Save\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! All we need is to record some of the information from our Heroku Postgres add-on in order to query the data from within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back under the App dashboard, click \"Heroku Postgres\".\n",
    "- Click the \"Settings\" tab and click \"View Credentials\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The information displayed here will be used to access the Postgres database. For the purposes of this example, we need to record URI. Make note of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Python to query data from Heroku App\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to import three common Python packages: pandas, numpy, and sqlalchemy (specifically, the create_engine definition). If they are not available, run __pip install sqlalchemy__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code imports the required dependancies."
